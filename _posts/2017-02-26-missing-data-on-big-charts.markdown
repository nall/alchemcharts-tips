I've seen cases where today's data is missing from charts Daily and bigger. Here's the fix.
<!--more-->

This happens if you don't have any intraday charts in the workspace. I had such a workspace that had only a Monthly and Weekly chart. By adding an intraday chart (any will do) and just minimizing it, the current day's data was reflected on the larger charts.

You may need to save the workspace and reopen it to see today's data reflected.
